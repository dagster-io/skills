    "- User requested to add a new Dagster asset named 'dwh_asset' with an empty body",
    "- **Used `dagster-skills:dagster-expert` skill** to get guidance on project structure and asset creation best practices",
    "- Skill output recommended using `dg scaffold` command and provided routing to relevant documentation",
    "- Attempted to check current Dagster definitions with `dg list defs` but encountered module import errors due to missing dependencies",
    "- Used Glob to find existing Python files in the project structure",
    "- Found the project at `/private/var/folders/4f/w5_v4gk12b120lh9bfrtq6140000gn/T/tmpq1xldtps/acme_co_dataeng/`",
    "- Read the main definitions file to understand the project uses `load_from_defs_folder` pattern",
    "- Checked the `defs` directory structure and found it was mostly empty",
    "- Used `dg scaffold defs dagster.asset` command to create the asset file (following the skill's recommended approach)",
    "- The scaffold command created the file at an incorrectly nested path, so moved it to the correct location: `src/acme_co_dataeng/defs/dwh_asset.py`",
    "- Read the scaffolded file which contained a basic asset with context parameter and return type",
    "- Edited the asset to have a minimal empty body by removing parameters and keeping the ellipsis placeholder",
    "- Verified the asset file was correctly updated",
    "- Ran `dg check defs` to validate all definitions loaded successfully",
    "- Successfully created the `dwh_asset` with an empty body that passes validation"
