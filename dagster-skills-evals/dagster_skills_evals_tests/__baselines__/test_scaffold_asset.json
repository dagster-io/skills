    "- User requested to add a new Dagster asset named 'dwh_asset' with an empty body",
    "- Invoked the **dagster-skills:dagster-expert** skill to understand project structure and how to add new assets",
    "- Discovered the project uses `dg scaffold` command for creating new definitions",
    "- Explored the project structure to find the `src/acme_co_dataeng/defs/` directory where assets should be placed",
    "- Ran `uv run dg scaffold defs dagster.asset defs/dwh_asset.py` to generate the asset file (created nested path issue)",
    "- Fixed the incorrect nested directory structure by moving the file to the correct location",
    "- Read the scaffolded file which contained a template with type hints and return annotations",
    "- Modified the asset to have a simple empty body with just `pass` statement using the Edit tool",
    "- Verified the asset was successfully registered by running `uv run dg list defs`, which showed `dwh_asset` in the Assets section"
