    "- User asked to configure the `customer_summary` asset to run eagerly on upstream updates, with a special monthly-sufficiency condition for the `zip_codes` dependency",
    "- The **dagster-expert** skill was invoked to handle the request",
    "- Skill read the declarative automation reference index, then the operators, customization, and operands reference files to understand available `AutomationCondition` building blocks",
    "- Skill searched the project and found the `customer_summary` asset in `src/acme_co_dataeng/defs/customer_summary.py`, which had three deps: `customer_events`, `sales_data`, and `zip_codes`",
    "- Skill designed a two-part condition: `eager().ignore(zip_codes)` for standard eager behavior on the other upstreams, combined with a `zip_codes_ready` condition using `newly_updated().since(cron_tick_passed(\"0 0 1 * *\"))` scoped via `.allow()` to only `zip_codes`",
    "- Skill edited the file to add the `zip_codes_ready` condition variable and an `automation_condition` argument to the `@dg.asset` decorator combining both parts with `&`",
    "- Skill noted that the `default_automation_condition_sensor` must be enabled in the Dagster UI for the automation to take effect"
