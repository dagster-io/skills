    "Here's a concise narrative summary of the session:",
    "",
    "- User requested configuration of materialization dependencies for the `customer_summary` asset",
    "- Invoked the **dagster-skills:dagster-expert** skill to find the asset definition and identify upstream dependencies",
    "- Used Grep to locate the `customer_summary` asset file",
    "- Read the asset file at `src/acme_co_dataeng/defs/customer_summary.py` and identified three upstream dependencies: `customer_events`, `sales_data`, and `zip_codes`",
    "- Read declarative automation reference documentation to understand how to configure different automation conditions for different dependencies",
    "- Read customization patterns documentation to learn about `.allow()` and `.ignore()` filtering methods",
    "- Read operators documentation to understand `any_deps_match()`, `since()`, and dependency filtering",
    "- Read operands documentation to understand `newly_updated()`, `cron_tick_passed()`, and time-based conditions",
    "- Searched for monthly/start-of-month patterns in automation documentation (no specific examples found)",
    "- Implemented the solution by editing the asset file to add an `automation_condition` that:",
    "  - Uses `eager().allow()` to trigger on `customer_events` or `sales_data` updates",
    "  - Uses `any_deps_match()` with `newly_updated().since(cron_tick_passed(\"0 0 1 * *\"))` to require `zip_codes` to have been updated since the start of the month",
    "  - Combines both conditions with AND operator",
    "- Explained the implementation and provided next steps for enabling the automation sensor"
