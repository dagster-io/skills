# Integrations Reference

Dagster provides integration libraries for a range of tools and technologies. This reference directory contains detailed information about specific integrations.

Integration libraries are typically named `dagster-<technology>`, where `<technology>` is the name of the tool or technology being integrated. Not all integration libraries currently have a dedicated reference directory.
